Design a simple e-commerce website for a small clothing store. 

The website should allow users to browse and purchase clothing items online. 

The store has a limited inventory of items, and there is no need for a shopping cart or complex inventory management system. 

However, the website should have a simple search functionality and display product details and pricing information. 

How would you design the classes and functions for this website?
